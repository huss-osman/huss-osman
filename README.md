## 💡 About Me

I’m an aspiring DevOps engineer focused on **building strong fundamentals before scaling into cloud and automation**.

My approach is simple:
- Learn how systems actually work  
- Break things intentionally  
- Fix them methodically  
- Document *why* solutions work  

I prioritise **Linux mastery, Bash scripting, and troubleshooting skills**, knowing these form the backbone of DevOps, cloud platforms, CI/CD, and containers.
