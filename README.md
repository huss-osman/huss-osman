# 👋 Hi, I’m Osman Hussein

**Aspiring DevOps Engineer** focused on building strong foundations in **Linux, Bash, and system-level understanding** through hands-on practice and documentation.

This repository documents **how I learn**, not just what I learn — with an emphasis on *why systems behave the way they do*, not memorising commands.

---

## 🎯 Repository Purpose

This repository exists to build and demonstrate **core DevOps foundations** before moving into higher-level tooling like Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms.

The focus is on:
- Understanding Linux internals and behaviour
- Writing predictable, safe Bash scripts
- Developing troubleshooting and operational thinking
- Reinforcing learning through real-world challenges

---

##🐧 Linux Fundamentals (Completed)

The Linux section focuses on command-line mastery and system understanding, rather than surface-level command usage.

# Topics Covered

- Terminal Basics
Navigating the filesystem, command structure, and efficient terminal usage.

- Shell Basics
Aliases, environment setup, and command execution flow.

- File System
Linux directory structure, files vs directories, and filesystem hierarchy.

- Permissions
Read, write, execute permissions, ownership, `chmod`, `chown`, and security concepts.

- Users and Groups
User management, groups, `sudo`, and access control.

- Environment Variables
`PATH`, exporting variables, and shell environment behaviour.

- Text Processing
Searching, filtering, and transforming text using `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, and pipelines.

- Redirection and Pipes
`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`, pipes, and chaining commands.

- Process Management
Inspecting running processes, background jobs, system monitoring, and safely stopping processes.

- Bash vs Zsh
Shell differences, configuration files, and usability comparisons.

- Vim Basics
Editing files efficiently using Vim.

## 🧪 Linux Reinforcement

### Bandit (Levels 1–12)

The OverTheWire Bandit wargame is used to reinforce Linux fundamentals through progressively harder challenges.

Each level documents:

- The challenge goal

- Commands used

- Why the solution works

- A key learning takeaway

Bandit is treated as a **learning exercise**, not a puzzle to brute-force.

## SadServers (Easy → Hard)

SadServers scenarios simulate real-world Linux issues commonly encountered in production environments.

Notes focus on:

- Observing system behaviour

- Forming and testing hypotheses

- Applying deliberate fixes

- Understanding root causes

## 🐚 Bash Scripting Fundamentals (In Progress)

The Bash section focuses on how Bash executes, not just syntax.

Rather than jumping straight into automation, the emphasis is on:

- Execution order

- Expansion and quoting

- Error handling and predictability

# Topics Covered So Far

- Writing and running Bash scripts

- Shebangs and execution permissions

- Comments and script structure

- Variables and parameters

- Arithmetic expansion

- Conditionals (if, case)

- Loops (for, while)

- Functions

- User input

- Pipes and redirection

- Exit codes

- Shell options (set)

- Environment variables and PATH

- Working with files

Each topic is documented as a standalone Markdown file with:

- Explanation

- Examples

- Key takeaways

---

# 🧠 Learning Approach

- Hands-on practice in real Linux environments (WSL, VMs)

- Solving problems before looking up solutions

- Documenting why commands work, not just what they do

- Revisiting concepts through Bandit and SadServers

- Treating confusion and mistakes as part of the learning process

- The goal is long-term understanding that transfers to production systems.

---

# 🚀 What’s Next

Planned future topics (added only when started):

- Git & version control workflows

- Networking fundamentals

- Containers & Docker

- Cloud fundamentals (AWS)

These will be added incrementally and intentionally, not rushed.
