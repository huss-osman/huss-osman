## Hi 👋 I’m Osman

Aspiring DevOps Engineer focused on building strong foundations in **Linux** and **Bash** through hands-on practice, troubleshooting, and clear documentation.

I’m intentionally learning DevOps from the ground up — prioritising **system behaviour, predictability, and automation fundamentals** over rushing into tools.

This repository serves as a living record of what I’ve learned, how I learned it, and why it works.

## 🔬 Featured Project: DevOps Learning

🔗 https://github.com/huss-osman/devops-learning

A hands-on learning repository focused on **Linux and Bash fundamentals**, reinforced through structured challenges and real-world troubleshooting scenarios.

The aim of this project is to:
- Understand how Linux systems behave internally
- Build strong command-line and scripting fundamentals
- Develop practical troubleshooting skills
- Document learning clearly for long-term reference

Rather than memorising commands, the emphasis is on **reasoning about system behaviour** and understanding cause-and-effect.

## 🐧 Linux Fundamentals (Completed)

A deep dive into how Linux works at the command line, focusing on concepts that underpin real production systems.

### What I Learned

**Filesystem & Navigation**
- Linux filesystem hierarchy (`/`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/home`, etc.)
- Absolute vs relative paths
- How tools interact with files and directories

**Permissions & Ownership**
- Read, write, and execute permissions
- User vs group vs other
- How `chmod`, `chown`, and `umask` affect system security
- Why permission issues are a common source of failures

**Users & Groups**
- User and group management
- Privilege escalation with `sudo`
- How Linux enforces access control

**Processes & System Behaviour**
- Inspecting running processes
- Foreground vs background jobs
- Signals and safe process termination
- Understanding system load and resource usage

**Text Processing & Data Flow**
- Using `grep`, `awk`, and `sed` to inspect and transform data
- Pipes and redirection (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`)
- Building small, composable command-line workflows

**Shell & Environment**
- Environment variables and shell expansion
- How commands are resolved via `PATH`
- Differences between shells at a high level

### Practical Reinforcement

Linux fundamentals were reinforced through:

**Bandit (OverTheWire)**  
Used to strengthen command-line fundamentals and problem-solving skills.  
Each level is documented with:
- The challenge goal  
- Commands used  
- Why the solution works  
- Key learning takeaways  

**SadServers**  
Used to simulate real-world Linux issues commonly encountered in production environments, focusing on:
- Observing symptoms rather than guessing
- Forming and testing hypotheses
- Applying fixes deliberately
- Understanding root causes instead of surface-level errors

## 🐚 Bash Scripting Fundamentals (In Progress)

Focused on understanding **how Bash executes scripts**, how data flows through them, and how to write scripts that behave predictably.

### What I’m Learning

**Script Execution**
- How the shebang works
- Execution permissions and script invocation
- Differences between interactive shells and scripts

**Variables & Expansion**
- Variable assignment and scope
- Quoting rules and why they matter
- Parameter expansion and common pitfalls

**Control Flow**
- Conditional logic (`if`, `case`)
- Looping constructs (`for`, `while`)
- Using loops to automate repetitive tasks safely

**Exit Codes & Error Handling**
- How commands signal success or failure
- Using exit codes correctly
- Writing scripts that fail loudly and predictably

**Functions & Structure**
- Writing reusable functions
- Passing arguments explicitly
- Avoiding hidden state and side effects

### Hands-On Practice
- Small automation scripts
- Interactive challenges (e.g. BashBattle-style exercises)
- Breaking scripts intentionally to understand behaviour
- Documenting examples and lessons learned

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- Learn by doing, breaking, and fixing
- Prefer understanding over memorisation
- Read `man` pages and experiment
- Treat mistakes as learning opportunities
- Build strong foundations before scaling into cloud, containers, and CI/CD

---

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

**Completed**
- Linux fundamentals

**In Progress**
- Bash scripting and automation

**Up Next**
- Git and version control
- Networking fundamentals
- Containers and Docker
- Cloud and CI/CD (later stages)
